## Project Overview

This project is a capstone for SWE5006 (DMSS, NUS) and demonstrates modern software design and testing practices. It is a single-page web app that lets users take a timed quiz, get instant feedback, and see their score at the end. The app is inspired by Kahoot but is fully self-contained and open source.

---

## Features

- **Modern UI**: Responsive, mobile-friendly, and visually appealing interface using Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons.
- **Quiz Flow**: Start, play, and complete a quiz with instant feedback on each answer.
- **Timer**: 30-second countdown per quiz session, with visual warning when time is low.
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score updates and final score summary.
- **Game State Management**: Start, playing, and game-over states with smooth transitions.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Prevents rapid/multiple clicks, handles browser refresh, and resets state as expected.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: End-to-end tests with Playwright, including UI, UX, and edge cases.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures question data integrity and correct scoring.

## Functional Test Cases

The following test cases are implemented and validated by automated tests:

### 1. Quiz Flow Tests

- **Start Quiz**: Quiz starts from the initial screen, timer initializes to 30 seconds, and the first question is displayed.
- **Answer Selection**: Selecting an answer highlights it, provides feedback, and auto-advances after 1.5 seconds.
- **Correct Answer Scoring**: Selecting the correct answer increases the score and shows positive feedback.
- **Incorrect Answer Handling**: Selecting an incorrect answer does not increase the score, highlights the correct answer, and shows negative feedback.
- **Complete Quiz**: Quiz ends after the last question, and the final score is displayed.

### 2. Timer Tests

- **Timer Countdown**: Timer counts down from 30 to 0 in 1-second intervals during the quiz.
- **Timer Expiry**: Quiz ends automatically when the timer reaches 0, and the final score is shown.
- **Timer Visual Feedback**: Visual warning (e.g., color change) when timer is low (≤10 seconds).

### 3. Game State Tests

- **Restart Quiz**: Clicking the restart button resets the quiz to the start state, with score and question index reset.
- **Question Navigation**: Question counter advances correctly and new questions are displayed as answers are selected.

### 4. UI/UX Tests

- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts properly to different screen sizes.
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected answers and feedback (correct/incorrect) are visually distinct.

### 5. Edge Case Tests

- **Rapid Answer Selection**: Only the first answer is registered if multiple options are clicked quickly.
- **Multiple Start Clicks**: Rapid clicking of the start button does not start multiple games or timers.
- **Browser Refresh**: Refreshing the browser during a quiz resets the game to the start state (no persistence).

### 6. Data Validation Tests

- **Question Data Integrity**: All questions have 4 options and valid correct answer indices.
- **Score Calculation**: Final score matches the number of correct answers selected.
- **Timer Data Validation**: Timer starts at 30, is numeric, and decrements by 1 each second.
