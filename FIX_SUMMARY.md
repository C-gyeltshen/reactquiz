# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

Based on the failing tests identified in TEST_REPORTING.md, the following issues were fixed:

### 1. Answer Selection CSS Classes

**Problem:** Tests were expecting `selected` or `bg-blue` classes on selected answers, but they weren't present.

**Fix:** Updated the `getButtonClass` function in `question-card.tsx` to include the required CSS classes:

- Added `correct` class to correct answers
- Added `selected` and `bg-blue` classes to selected answers

### 2. Feedback Styling

**Problem:** Tests were expecting specific class patterns for feedback (`green|success` or `red|error`) but they weren't present.

**Fix:** Updated the feedback div in `question-card.tsx` to include:

- `green` and `success` classes for correct answers
- `red` and `error` classes for incorrect answers

### 3. Timer Warning State

**Problem:** Timer didn't show warning classes when the time was low.

**Fix:** Modified the `Timer` component to:

- Add `red`, `warning`, and `danger` classes when time is â‰¤ 10 seconds
- Change text color to red for visual feedback
- Add pulse animation to the timer icon for additional visual feedback

### 4. Game Restart Flow

**Problem:** After completing a quiz and restarting, the "Start Quiz" button wasn't visible.

**Fix:**

- Added a dedicated `handleRestart` function to properly reset the game state to the start screen
- Fixed a typo in the transition-colors class in the GameOver component

## Test Cases Addressed

These changes should fix the following failing test categories:

1. **UI/Component Issues**

   - Fixed CSS class expectations for selected answers
   - Added appropriate success/error feedback classes
   - Added warning classes to timer when time is low

2. **Navigation/Visibility Issues**

   - Ensured "Start Quiz" button is visible after restart by properly resetting game state

3. **Timing/Asynchronous Issues**
   - Added visual feedback for timer expiry
   - Button click behaviors should be more consistent with tests

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests to verify that all the fixed cases now pass
2. If any tests are still failing, additional fixes may be required
